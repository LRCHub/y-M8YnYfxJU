Feel like sun on my skin
So, this is love
I know it is
I know it sounds super cliché
But you make me feel some type of way
This is falling, falling in love

It doesn't really matter how many words I know
They're just the same different ways to say "I love you" so
I know you might be thinking that I always say it a lot
But I just wanna tell you how I feel with all I've got
Kasi mahal kita, neoppuniya
Anata de aru dake de watashi wo shiawase ni suru
Ní de wéixiào, la tua risata
No words can express
The feeling I get just by being with you

Feel like sun on my skin (warm and fuzzy, feels so happy)
So, this is love (can't hide how I feel anymore)
I know it is
I know it sounds super cliché
But you make me feel some type of way
This is falling, falling in love
I know it sounds super cliché
But you make me feel some type of way
This is falling, falling in love (yeah)
This is falling, falling in love (ooh)
This is falling, falling in love
